The motion follows a parabolic trajectory due to the constant acceleration caused by gravity. Key Components Initial Velocity (v\u2080) : The velocity with which the projectile is launched. Angle of Projection (\u03b8) : The angle at which the projectile is launched with respect to the horizontal. Acceleration Due to Gravity (g) : The constant acceleration acting downward, typically 9.8 m/s\u00b2 on Earth. Time of Flight (T) : The total time the projectile remains in the air. Maximum Height (H) : The highest vertical position reached by the projectile. Range (R) : The horizontal distance covered by the projectile. Equations of Motion Using kinematic equations, we can derive the following formulas for projectile motion: 1. Time of Flight (T) \\[ T = \\frac{2v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] 2. Maximum Height (H) \\[ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin(\\theta))^2}{2g} \\] 3. Range (R) \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] 4.

It is commonly used in clocks, physics experiments, and engineering applications. Types of Pendulums Simple Pendulum : A mass (bob) attached to a string or rod with negligible mass. Compound Pendulum : A rigid body swinging about a fixed point. Foucault Pendulum : Demonstrates Earth's rotation. Forced & Damped Pendulum : Includes external forces and resistance. Forced Damped Pendulum: Small-Angle Approximation The forced damped pendulum is governed by the following second-order differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Where: \\( \\theta(t) \\) is the angular displacement, \\( \\beta \\) is the damping coefficient, \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum (for small angles), \\( F_0 \\) is the amplitude of the driving force, \\( \\omega \\) is the driving frequency, \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) for small angles. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\( \\theta \\approx 0 \\) ), \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) , so the equation simplifies to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a standard forced damped harmonic oscillator equation. Solution to the Differential Equation The solution consists of two parts: Homogeneous Solution (Undriven) : The general solution to the homogeneous equation \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = 0 \\) is: \\[ \\theta_h(t) = A e^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi) \\] Where \\( \\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} \\) is the damped frequency. Particular Solution (Driven) : The particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\) is: \\[ \\theta_p(t) = \\frac{F_0}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2} \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Thus, the total solution is the sum of both: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\theta_h(t) + \\theta_p(t) \\] Resonance Conditions Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \\( \\omega \\) matches the natural frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) of the system, i.e., \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\) . At resonance, the system experiences maximum amplitude oscillations, which can lead to large oscillations and potential system failure due to energy buildup. Energy Implications Non-Resonant Case : When \\( \\omega \\neq \\omega_0 \\) , the system oscillates with an amplitude determined by the balance between the driving force and damping. Resonance : At resonance, the energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum is maximized, leading to a significant increase in amplitude. If damping is small, the system can oscillate with large amplitude for long durations, which can result in high energy accumulation.
